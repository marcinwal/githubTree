# javaScript and node play

This small up finds github followers of a give person.
It uses js and node to call github api and fatches data to put them in a form of a tree;

The main purpose of the exarcice was to practice both js and node and to use asynchronous calls which I used for api calls; 
Plan going forward is to add more functionality via D3 tools which should represent the tree in a nice way;

I would like to solve same problem later in parallel way in C most likely.
